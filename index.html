    <main>
        <p>Thank you, WeTrust team, for leaving this homepage for me. I’ve found what I believe to be the best solution to our shared problem: the Ghostrider algorithm.</p>
        <p>I know we all have our preferences, but I genuinely think that enhancing the Ghostrider protocol through a collaborative alliance could unlock unimaginable potential, especially in areas like data transfers and medical records.</p>
        <p>Moving forward, I’ll focus on mining Raptoreum and other Ghostrider-based coins.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I have no direct way to contact anyone, so I’ll leave this note here:</p>
